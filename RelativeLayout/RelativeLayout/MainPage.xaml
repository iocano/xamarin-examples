	Relative Layout
	Used to position and size children relative to properties of the layout or sibling elements. 
	with ConstraintExpressions
	ConstraintExpression defines the following properties:
		Constant(double):		represents the constraint constant value (Add/Substract to final value)
		ElementName(string):	represents the name of a source element against which to calculate the constraint.
		Factor(double):			represents the factor by which to scale a constrained dimension, relative to the source element. This property defaults to 1.
		Property(string):		represents the name of the property on the source element to use in the constraint calculation.
		Type(ConstraintType):	represents the type of the constraint.

	ConstraintType
		Constant			constant constraint.
		RelativeToParent	constraint that is relative to a parent element.
		RelativeToVie		constraint that is relative to a view.
